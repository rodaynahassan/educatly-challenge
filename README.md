Second, run the frontend using:

And voila, here is the easiet application to track your working hours!

# Material UI

Material UI was used in this project in order to build a scalable, interactive design with vibrant colors and visual props. It was the only UI library used to avoid using multiple libraries and put extra load on the project.

# Interacting with the webpage

    - The table displayed is only for one employee showing his working hours history
    - The day is added automatically to the table, unless it's Friday or Saturday (assuming they are the official holidays).
    - The employee should fulfill 8 working hours per day.
    - You should add the arriving time first to be able to enter the lunch break and exit time.
    - The arrived time should be between 8 AM and 6 PM
    - The lunch break and exit time should be greater than the arrived time and also between 8 AM and 6 PM.
    - You cannot edit the time after entering it.
    - Once the arrived and exit time are entered, the working hours per that day along with the status (Above or below) will be displayed.
    - If the day passed without adding the arrived or exit time, the record for this day wonâ€™t be displayed and it will be removed from the table. This is to encourage the employees to add the data consistently; day by day.

# Extra feature

    - It will also calculate the working hours in the last 7 days.
        Example: If we are on Tuesday, the working hours from last Tuesday to Monday will be displayed.
